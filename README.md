# HelloWorldLab
Github README Assignment

This is a simple Hello World Android application. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate basic proficiency with Android Studio.

The application has an editable text field and a button that changes the "World" in "Hi, World" with the text that the user entered into the field.

You can run the application within the emulator in Android Studio or on any Android device.

While the initial project is complete, future changes should be aesthetic in nature. For example, correcting the "Hi, World" to a proper "Hello, World".

Project maintained by Karl Morris with contributions from his CIS 3515 Mobile Application Development students.
